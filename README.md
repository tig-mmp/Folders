# Folders.py

After watching the video The [Folders programming language - No code, just folders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Igh-vBI2LXc) from [Khalili Oriented Programming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrVWVOBoBu7W-aXbApDEuyQ) channel, I found the concept of the language [Folders](https://github.com/rottytooth/Folders) realy interesting.

But this language is a bit complicated to program, a lot of time will be spent creating a giant folder structure that in other languages would be typed quickly. So this program just prints my name.

In Windows Operating System, all `Folders` programs are 0 bytes because Windows interprets an empty folder as 0 bytes.

## Installation

```
pip install Folders
```

## Running the program

```
Folders PrintTiagoPinto
```

or

```
Folders.exe PrintTiagoPinto
```

or

```
python Folders.py PrintTiagoPinto
```

## Output

The output is `Tiago Pinto`
